Information
-----------

This package provides a template when submitting a Phd dissertation
to the [Arenberg Doctoral School](http://set.kuleuven.be/phd/) at
[KU Leuven](http://kuleuven.be).

Latest version of the ADS PhD template is available at 
[github.com/wannesm/adsphd](https://github.com/wannesm/adsphd).

Questions and issues can be submitted to the 
[ADS PhD issues component](https://github.com/wannesm/adsphd/issues) 
at Github.


Directory structure
-------------------

The directory structure looks like this

* `thesis.tex`: Main tex file for the final booklet.
* `defs.tex`: Put your own preamble settings here.
* `run.py`: Simple compilation script.
* `Makefile`
* `Makefile.settings`: This file contains file names and other
                       settings used by make.
* `biblatex.cfg`: Biblatex settings.
* `chapters`
    * `chapter1`: Per chapter a directory with
        * `chapter1.tex`: Tex file with *identical* name
        * `image/`: Images directory. Note that to include
                    a figure in chapter1.tex, you should
                    NOT include the relative path, i.e.,
                    `\includegraphics{myfigure}` and not
                    `{image/myfigure}`!


Using Latex directly
--------------------

The adsphd.cls can be used directly by latex:

    pdflatex thesis
    bibtex thesis
    # biber thesis
    makeindex thesis.glo -s thesis.ist -t thesis.glg -o thesis.gls
    makeindex thesis.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o thesis.nls
    pdflatex thesis
    pdflatex thesis

Any other Latex build tool like latexmk, rubber, SCons, TeXShop or TeXWorks 
should also work out of the box (`makeindex` might not run by default).

Using the simple Python compile script
--------------------------------------

There is a simple and naive Python compilation script supplied which should
work cross-platform.

    python3 run.py             # Compile to pdf
    python3 run.py clean       # Clean auxiliary files
    python3 run.py cleanall    # Clean everything
    python3 run.py newchapter  # Set up files for a new chapter
    python3 run.py --help      # Help and more options

Some settings are available at the top of the `run.py` file.

Using make and other utility scripts
------------------------------------

Some convenient Makefile targets:

**In the main directory [`./`]**:

    make                       # create the full booklet thesis.pdf
    make clean
    make realclean             # cleanup all mess, including leftover
                               # {dvi,pdf,ps} files of main file or the
                               # chapters
    make damnthatsreallyclean  # brutally remove all possible temporary
                               # files


**In a chapter directory [`./chapters/chapterX`]**:

For this to work you need to generate the chapter directory using the
`makeemptychapter.sh` script which also generates a custom Makefile for
the new chapter.

    make                       # Creates chapterX.pdf containing the
                               # TOC, the contents of only chapterX and
                               # the bibliography.
    make bare                  # Create chapterX.pdf containing only the 
                               # chapter text (no TOC, no bibliography).
    make clean                 # remove temporary files left from
                               # compilation
    make realclean             # clean + also remove {ps,pdf} files
    make figurelist            # Print out the names of all figures that are
                                 effectively used in ./chapters/chapterX/chapterX.tex
    make cover                 # Generate a separate pdf the cover


**Creating a chapter directory**:
  
    ./chapters/makeemptychapter.sh # Create the directory structure for a new
                                   # chapter.

**Settings**:

Settings for the Makefile script can be found in the `makefile.settings`
file.

Most of the useful commands provided by this class can be found in the provided
example file `thesis.tex`.


Chapters
--------

**Inclusion of normal chapters**

Use the command `\inputchapter{.}`, e.g., 

    \inputchapter{introduction}

includes `./chapters/introduction/introduction.tex`.

If the chapter is an appendix, use `\inputappendix{.}`!


**Inclusion of 'special' chapters**

The term 'special' chapters refers to the

- preface                 (`preface`)
- dutch preface           (`prefacenl`)
- abstract                (`abstract`)
- dutch abstract          (`abstractnl`)
- list of publications    (`publications`)
- curriculum vitae        (`cv`)

To include any of the above, use the command

    \inputXXX{filename}

where `XXX` stands for the name indicated in between brackets above, and filename
is as in the \inputchapter command. For instance,

    \inputappendix{myappendix} % includes ./chapters/myappendix/myappendix.tex as an appendix

Other special chapters are

  - list of figures
  - list of tables
  - table of contents
  - bibliography

but these different from the above as they are generated using standard
commands (`\listoffigures`, `\listoftables`, `\tableofcontents`,
`\inputbibliography`).

For typical usage, see the provided file `thesis.tex`.


Generating the cover page
-------------------------

Most printing services will create their own cover page based
on the details you send them (title, name, affiliation, ...). The template
generates only a front and back cover for the version you want to distribute online,
not for the version you send to the printing service.

However, the template has some support to create a separate cover page. Use
`make cover` or `python run.py cover` to generate `cover.tex` and run.


Troubleshooting
---------------

* To be able to make the chapter compilation work, you should make sure that
  the desired chapter is included in thesis.tex (e.g., using
  `\inputchapter{introduction})`!!
* If you get spurious empty pages when compiling a single chapter, this is
  probably due to the combination of `\cleardoublepage` and `\inputonly`. To
  avoid it, make sure you end all included chapters (and appendices) with
  `\cleardoublepage` (if you use `makeemptychapter.sh` to generate the chapter
  skeleton this is automatically done!)


Todos
-----

We recommend the todonotes package for annotating your text with todo
notes. Note that the adsphd automatically disables todo notes when making
the final version.

    \todo{This is a todo}%
    \todo[inline]{This is a todo}%

**Remark**: to make the above commands interact as little as possible with your
normal text, alway add a % directly after the closing bracket.

If you want to disable todo notes explicitly, you can change the call
`\usepackage{todonotes}` in defs.tex to
`\usepackage[disable]{todonotes}`.


Presentation template
---------------------

A Beamer template has been created by 
[Roland Pastorino](http://www.rolandpastorino.com) and is available on the [KU Leuven 
template page](http://www.kuleuven.be/communicatie/publicaties/powerpointsjablonen).
