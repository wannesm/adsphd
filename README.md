ADS PhD LaTeX template
======================

Information
-----------

This package provides a template when submitting a Phd dissertation
to the [Arenberg Doctoral School](http://set.kuleuven.be/phd/) at
[KU Leuven](http://kuleuven.be).

Latest version of the ADS PhD template is available at 
[github.com/wannesm/adsphd](https://github.com/wannesm/adsphd).

Questions and issues can be submitted to the 
[ADS PhD issues component](https://github.com/wannesm/adsphd/issues) 
at Github.

For a Beamer presentation template take a look at the [KU Leuven presentation
template](http://www.kuleuven.be/communicatie/publicaties/powerpointsjablonen).


Directory structure
-------------------

The directory structure looks like this

* `thesis.tex`: Main tex file for the final booklet.
* `defs.tex`: Put your own preamble settings here.
* `run.py`: Simple compilation script.
* `Makefile`
* `Makefile.settings`: This file contains file names and other
                       settings used by make.
* `biblatex.cfg`: Biblatex settings.
* `chapters`
    * `chapter1`: Per chapter a directory with
        * `chapter1.tex`: Tex file with *identical* name
        * `image/`: Images directory. Note that to include
                    a figure in chapter1.tex, you should
                    NOT include the relative path, i.e.,
                    `\includegraphics{myfigure}` and not
                    `{image/myfigure}`!

Using Latex directly
--------------------

The adsphd.cls can be used directly by latex:

    pdflatex thesis
    bibtex thesis
    # biber thesis
    pdflatex thesis
    pdflatex thesis

Any other Latex build tool like latexmk, rubber, SCons, TeXShop or TeXWorks 
should also work out of the box.

Using the simple Python compile script
--------------------------------------

There is a simple and naive Python compilation script supplied which should
work cross-platform.

    ./run.py             # Compile to pdf
    ./run.py clean       # Clean auxiliary files
    ./run.py cleanall    # Clean everything
    ./run.py newchapter  # Set up files for a new chapter
    ./run.py --help      # Help and more options

If you want to specify the Python version to be used explicitely you can use
the command as follows:

    python3 run.py

Some settings are available at the top of the `run.py` file.

Using make and other utility scripts
------------------------------------

Some convenient Makefile targets:

**In the main directory [`./`]**:

    make                       # create the full booklet thesis.pdf
    make clean
    make realclean             # cleanup all mess, including leftover
                               # {dvi,pdf,ps} files of main file or the
                               # chapters
    make damnthatsreallyclean  # brutally remove all possible temporary
                               # files


**In a chapter directory [`./chapters/chapterX`]**:

    make                       # Creates chapterX.pdf containing the
                               # TOC, the contents of only chapterX and
                               # the bibliography.
    make bare                  # Create chapterX.pdf containing only the 
                               # chapter text (no TOC, no bibliography).
    make clean                 # remove temporary files left from
                               # compilation
    make realclean             # clean + also remove {ps,pdf} files
    make figurelist            # Print out the names of all figures that are
                                 effectively used in ./chapters/chapterX/chapterX.tex


**Other convenient scripts**:
  
    ./chapters/makeemptychapter.sh # Create the directory structure for a new
                                   # chapter.

Settings for the Makefile script can be found in the `makefile.settings`
file.

Most of the useful commands provided by this class can be found in the provided
example file `thesis.tex`.


Chapters
--------

**Inclusion of normal chapters**

Use the command `\includechapter{.}`, e.g., 

    \includechapter{introduction}

includes `./chapters/introduction/introduction.tex`.

If the chapter is an appendix, use `\includeappendix{.}`!


**Inclusion of 'special' chapters**

The term 'special' chapters refers to the

- preface                 (`preface`)
- dutch abstract          (`prefacenl`)
- abstract                (`abstract`)
- dutch abstract          (`abstractnl`)
- list of publications    (`publications`)
- curriculum vitae        (`cv`)

To include any of the above, use the command

    \includeXXX{filename}

where `XXX` stands for the name indicated in between brackets above, and filename
is as in the \includechapter command. For instance,

    \includeappendix{myappendix} % includes ./chapters/myappendix/myappendix.tex as an appendix

Other special chapters are

  - list of figures
  - list of tables
  - table of contents
  - bibliography

but these different from the above as they are generated using standard
commands (`\listoffigures`, `\listoftables`, `\tableofcontents`,
`\includebibliography`).

For typical usage, see the provided file `thesis.tex`.


Generating the cover page
-------------------------

**Important**: most printing services will create their own cover page based
on the details you send them (title, name, affiliation, ...) and do not supply
you with all necessary parameters (e.g., thickness of the paper) because these
differ from machine to machine. Therefore, the generated cover page is only
indicative and probably not used by your printing server (or even correct).


A full cover page (combining front cover, spine and back cover) can be
generated automatically using the command 'make cover'. This creates a pdf
`$(COVERPDF)`; by default this is `cover.pdf`.

The width of the spine is set by redefining `\adsphdspinewidth` (9mm by default).

It can be seen in the provided `thesis.tex` that all information necessary to
generate a cover page is contained between two markers

    %%% COVER: Settings %%%
    ...
    %%% COVER: End settings %%%

DO NOT REMOVE THESE!! They are used by the Makefile!!

The default front and/or back cover page can be overwritten: 

 - create a file `mycoverpage.tex`
 - redefine the commands `\makefrontcovergeneral` and `\makebackcovergeneral`. For
   an example and more information, see the provided file `mycoverpage.tex`.

The cover page in the generated pdf has the following structure:

    <--rbleed--> <--backcoverpage--> <--lbleed--> <--spine width--> <--lbleed--> <--frontcoverpage--> <--rbleed-->

The default bleed (both lbleed and rbleed) is 7mm. I suggest not changing this
value unless you know what you are doing ;) The latter can be done by
redefining `\defaultlbleed` and `\defaultrbleed` respectively.



Troubleshooting
---------------

* To be able to make the chapter compilation work, you should make sure that
  the desired chapter is included in thesis.tex (e.g., using
  `\includechapter{introduction})`!!
* If you get spurious empty pages when compiling a single chapter, this is
  probably due to the combination of `\cleardoublepage` and `\includeonly`. To
  avoid it, make sure you end all included chapters (and appendices) with
  `\cleardoublepage` (if you use `makeemptychapter.sh` to generate the chapter
  skeleton this is automatically done!)


Todos
-----

We recommend the todonotes package for annotating your text with todo
notes. Some commands that might be useful. Note that the adsphd
automatically disables todo notes when making the final version.

    \todo{This is a todo}
    \todo[inline]{This is a todo}

**Remark**: to make the above commands interact as little as possible with your
normal text, alway add a % directly after the closing bracket.

If you want to disable todo notes explicitly, you can change the call
`\usepackage{todonotes}` in defs.tex to
`\usepackage[disable]{todonotes}`.


Presentation template

Tips and tricks
---------------

Finetuning the backref package (when _not_ using biblatex). Add the
   following to your preamble:

    % See [http://n2.nabble.com/backref-td478438.html]:
    % simple backref command redefinition to avoid double entries
    \makeatletter
    \ifadsphd@biblatex\else
      \ifadsphd@pagebackref%
        \renewcommand*{\backref}[1]{}
        % redefinition of the actually used \backrefalt 
        \renewcommand*{\backrefalt}[4]{% 
        \ifcase #1 % 
           % case: not cited 
        \or 
           % case: cited on exactly one page 
           Cited on page~#2.
        \else 
           % case: cited on multiple pages 
           Cited on pages~#2.
        \fi}
      \else
        \renewcommand*{\backref}[1]{}
        % redefinition of the actually used \backrefalt 
        \renewcommand*{\backrefalt}[4]{% 
        \ifcase #1 % 
           % case: not cited 
        \or 
           % case: cited on exactly one page 
           Cited in Section~#2.
        \else 
           % case: cited on multiple pages 
           Cited in Sections~#2.
        \fi}
      \fi
    \fi
    \makeatother
