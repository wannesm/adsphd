Information
-----------

This package provides a template when submitting a Phd dissertation
to the [Arenberg Doctoral School](http://set.kuleuven.be/phd/) at
[KU Leuven](http://kuleuven.be).

Latest version of the ADS PhD template is available at 
[github.com/wannesm/adsphd](https://github.com/wannesm/adsphd).

Questions and issues can be submitted to the 
[ADS PhD issues component](https://github.com/wannesm/adsphd/issues) 
at Github.


Directory structure
-------------------

The directory structure looks like this

* `thesis.tex`: Main tex file for the final booklet.
* `run.py`: Simple compilation script.
* `Makefile`
* `Makefile.settings`: This file contains file names and other
                       settings used by make.
* `chapters`
    * `chapter1`: Per chapter a directory with
        * `chapter1.tex`: Tex file with *identical* name
        * `image/`: Images directory. Note that to include
                    a figure in chapter1.tex, you should
                    NOT include the relative path, i.e.,
                    `\includegraphics{myfigure}` and not
                    `{image/myfigure}`!


Using Latex directly
--------------------

The adsphd.cls class can be used directly by latex:

    pdflatex thesis
    bibtex thesis
    # biber thesis
    makeindex thesis.glo -s thesis.ist -t thesis.glg -o thesis.gls
    makeindex thesis.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o thesis.nls
    pdflatex thesis
    pdflatex thesis

Any other Latex build tool like latexmk, rubber, SCons, TeXShop or TeXWorks 
should also work out of the box (`makeindex` might not run by default in which
case you will not see the glossary).


Using the simple Python compile script
--------------------------------------

There is a simple and naive Python compilation script supplied which should
work cross-platform.
It is also available as Windows exe (`run.exe`) without the need for Python
itself.

    python3 run.py             # Compile to pdf
    python3 run.py clean       # Clean auxiliary files
    python3 run.py realclean   # Clean everything
    python3 run.py newchapter  # Set up files for a new chapter
    python3 run.py --help      # Help and more options

Some settings are available at the top of the `run.py` file.

TexWorks
--------

It is possible the setup the above run script as the processing tool in
TexWorks, by going into Edit > Preferences > Typesetting.
Under `processing tools`, click the plus sign and select the `run.py` or
`run.exe` file by clicking "browse".
Optionally, you can add the `--ignore-errors` argument to always do a full 
run of LaTeX.
Now you should be able to select and run your the tool in the TexWorks editor.


Using make and other utility scripts
------------------------------------

Some convenient Makefile targets:

**In the main directory [`./`]**:

    make                       # create the full booklet thesis.pdf
    make clean
    make realclean             # cleanup all mess, including leftover
                               # {dvi,pdf,ps} files of main file or the
                               # chapters
    make damnthatsreallyclean  # brutally remove all possible temporary
                               # files


**In a chapter directory [`./chapters/chapterX`]**:

For this to work you need to generate the chapter directory using the
`makeemptychapter.sh` script which also generates a custom Makefile for
the new chapter.

    make                       # Creates chapterX.pdf containing the
                               # TOC, the contents of only chapterX and
                               # the bibliography.
    make bare                  # Create chapterX.pdf containing only the 
                               # chapter text (no TOC, no bibliography).
    make clean                 # remove temporary files left from
                               # compilation
    make realclean             # clean + also remove {ps,pdf} files
    make figurelist            # Print out the names of all figures that are
                                 effectively used in ./chapters/chapterX/chapterX.tex
    make cover                 # Generate a separate pdf the cover


**Creating a chapter directory**:
  
    ./chapters/makeemptychapter.sh # Create the directory structure for a new
                                   # chapter.

**Settings**:

Settings for the Makefile script can be found in the `makefile.settings`
file.

Most of the useful commands provided by this class can be found in the provided
example file `thesis.tex`.


Chapters
--------

**Inclusion of normal chapters**

Use the command `\includechapter{.}`, e.g., 

    \includechapter{introduction}

includes `./chapters/introduction/introduction.tex`.

If the chapter is an appendix, use `\includeappendix{.}`!


**Inclusion of 'special' chapters**

The term 'special' chapters refers to the

- preface                 (`preface`)
- dutch preface           (`prefacenl`)
- abstract                (`abstract`)
- dutch abstract          (`abstractnl`)
- list of publications    (`publications`)
- curriculum vitae        (`cv`)

To include any of the above, use the command

    \includeXXX{filename}

where `XXX` stands for the name indicated in between brackets above, and filename
is as in the \includechapter command. For instance,

    \includeappendix{myappendix} % includes ./chapters/myappendix/myappendix.tex as an appendix

Other special chapters are

  - list of figures
  - list of tables
  - table of contents
  - bibliography

but these different from the above as they are generated using standard
commands (`\listoffigures`, `\listoftables`, `\tableofcontents`,
`\includebibliography`).

For typical usage, see the provided file `thesis.tex`.


Loaded packages
---------------

The following packages are loaded automatically by the adsphd.cls class:

- babel
- calc
- datatool
- etoolbox
- fancyhdr
- fontenc

- ifpdf
- iftex
- ifthen
- kvoptions
- listings
- lmodern
- microtype
- placeins
- rotating
- setspace
- showlabels
- textpos
- xcolor


Generating the cover page
-------------------------

Most printing services will create their own cover page based
on the details you send them (title, name, affiliation, ...). The template
generates only a front and back cover for the version you want to distribute online,
not for the version you send to the printing service.

However, the template has some support to create a separate cover page. Use
`make cover` or `python run.py cover` to generate `cover.tex` and run.


Troubleshooting
---------------

* To be able to make the chapter compilation work, you should make sure that
  the desired chapter is included in thesis.tex (e.g., using
  `\includechapter{introduction})`!!
* If you get spurious empty pages when compiling a single chapter, this is
  probably due to the combination of `\cleardoublepage` and `\includeonly`. To
  avoid it, make sure you end all included chapters (and appendices) with
  `\cleardoublepage` (if you use `makeemptychapter.sh` to generate the chapter
  skeleton this is automatically done!)
